# My own journey

## Corne (June 2025)
Form: split 42 keys (3x6 + 3 thumb)

My first build. The goal was finding a low-profile wireless split keyboard with trackpad. Secondary goal was to source as much as possible pre-soldered and from suppliers in Europe.

splitkb.com (Netherlands) has a pre-soldered Corne kit: the [Halcyon Corne](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-kits/products/halcyon-corne). It even has a [solderless trackpad module](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/halcyon-cirque-touchpad-module?_pos=2&_fid=bcd054caa&_ss=c).

However it's only wired, and while there's an [wireless version in progress](https://blog.splitkb.com/spring-2025/#the-future) it will [take longer than initially planned](https://discord.com/channels/574598631399751680/574598631399751682/1376924067147288616).

typeractive.xyz (US) also has [pre-soldered wireless Corne boards](https://typeractive.xyz/products/corne-partially-assembled-pcb?variant=45739876122855) (both MX and Choc switches).

keycapsss.com (Germany) has a similar [solderless trackpad](https://keycapsss.com/GlidePoint-Cirque-Trackpad-TM040040-TM035035/KC10166-40-C) solution based on a Cirque trackpad with an [FFC/FPC to I2C adapter](https://github.com/keyboard-magpie/minimal-fpc-i2c-pcb) that is pin-compatible with nice!view.

I sourced the following materials:

### Lessons learned

Physical compatibility is hard.
Manufacturing is easier than I expected (at small scales, at least).
ZMK (and Zephyr RTOS) is powerful and flexible.
